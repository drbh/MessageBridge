Need to add a package json file and need to indstall `osa-imessage` and `@slack/client`

Your gonna need a BOT token and a SLACK admin token, as well as the BOT channel ID.

You need to make a new app in Slack and do some setup there.

Also the system for storing numbers is not smart at all (just writes to file) - needs to be fixed.

Lastly, there is a bug where messages were getting double sent.
